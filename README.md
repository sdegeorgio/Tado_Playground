Reverse engineering Tado smart heating control system

I was fed up with there being no solution to the poor coverage of the Tado smart home heating and hot water control system.  I tried placing it in many different locations within my home but it would never connect to all devices at once.  There are two solutions I came up with:
1. Improve the RF range, or
2. Develop a repeater device

The Internet bridge is the heart of the tado mesh and this guide details a teardown and functional analysis.

This repository contains some scripts to help with reverse engineering and understanding how the system works.

Head over to the wiki section of the page for more details.
